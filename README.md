The idea of this repository is to create a rigorous undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum in data science. The repository includes two main folders: Mathematics and Computer Science, each divided into four sections.

(i) Prerequisites (basic theoretical knowledge needed to begin the essentials of data science)

(ii) Undergraduate curriculum (essential theoretical knowledge in data science that prepares students for advanced graduate topics)

(iii) Postgraduate curriculum (offers advanced topics in data science)

(iv) PhD level (offers state-of-the-art methodological solutions in data science)
